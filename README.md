# Required Stuff
- install git

# SETUP
If you new to this, just make a workspace. I used $HOME/workspace/goprojects, you can use anything, but my examples are based on this. In the code there is nothing to enforce that assumption.

- `cd $HOME/workspace`
- `mkdir goprojects`
- `export GOPATH=$HOME/workspace/goprojects`
- `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`
